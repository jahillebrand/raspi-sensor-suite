# Raspi Sensor Suite
## Simple python script to send the user a Pushbullet notification with the host device's IP address

To set up this script:
1. Clone the repo to your machine with `wget https://github.com/ElegantDestruction/raspi-ip-pusher.git`
2. Put the get\_ip\_addr.py file in a safe location on your machine
3. Edit the get\_ip\_addr.py file and insert your Pushbullet [Access Token](https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings) on line 18 for the `<pushbullet auth here>` string
3. type `crontab -e` and pick an editor (if you've never used it before; nano is the easiest to use)
4. Go to the end of the file, and type `@reboot python /path/to/the/get_ip_addr.py &`
5. Save the file

## Note
This script is designed to run when the Raspberry Pi first boots. When this script runs, it will first pause for roughly 45 seconds to allow the system to fully boot and let network manager connect to a network. Only then will the program find the machine's IP address and push it to the Pushbullet account designated with the Access Token entered in the script. Additionally, if the program fails to retrieve an IP, it will wait 5 seconds, then try again. This process will repeat indefinitely. In the event the user is on a DHCP network and suddenly loses connection, the user simply needs to reboot the Pi.

Have fun!
